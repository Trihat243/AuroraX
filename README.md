This is featherboot, a lightweight operting system kernel written in NASM assembly. This version of the kernel has not been debugged yet so it may not work. When visiting this repo, please think about debugging it.

#Note:
Instructions on how to use this kernel will not be provided because the kernel is in such an early stage of development
